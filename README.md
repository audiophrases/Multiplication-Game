# Multiplication Mania

This repository contains a small web-based game to practice multiplication tables. The game is entirely client-side and runs in the browser.

## Playing

1. Open `index.html` in any modern browser. No additional setup is required.

2. The game begins with a short repeated-addition exercise at **Level 0** (60s timer, max two mistakes). Spin the wheel, complete this addition practice, then follow the prompts to practice multiplication and advance through the levels.
3. Scores and the current level are saved in `localStorage`, so your progress and high scores persist between sessions.

Enjoy sharpening your math skills!

## Development

Install dependencies and run the tests using:

```bash
npm install
npm test
```

2. Follow the prompts to spin the wheel, practice addition and multiplication, and progress through the levels. There is no time limit while playing, but the time you take and your mistakes determine the points you earn at the end of each level.
3. Scores and the current level are saved in `localStorage`, so your progress and high scores persist between sessions.
