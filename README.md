# Multiplication Mania

This repository contains a small web-based game to practice multiplication tables. The game is entirely client-side and runs in the browser.

## Playing

1. Open `index.html` in any modern browser. No additional setup is required.
2. Follow the prompts to spin the wheel, practice addition and multiplication, and progress through the levels. Each activity begins once you press **Start**. There is no time limit while playing, but the time you take and your mistakes determine the points you earn at the end of each level.
3. Scores and the current level are saved in `localStorage`, so your progress and high scores persist between sessions.

Enjoy sharpening your math skills!
