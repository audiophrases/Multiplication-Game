# Multiplication Mania

This repository contains a small web-based game to practice multiplication tables. The game is entirely client-side and runs in the browser.

## Playing

1. Open `index.html` in any modern browser. No additional setup is required.
2. The game begins with a short repeated-addition exercise at **Level 0**. Spin the wheel, complete the addition practice, then follow the prompts to practice multiplication and advance through the levels.
3. Scores and the current level are saved in `localStorage`, so your progress and high scores persist between sessions.

Enjoy sharpening your math skills!

## Development

Install dependencies and run the tests using:

```bash
npm install
npm test
```
