# Multiplication Mania

This repository contains a small web-based game to practice multiplication tables. The game is entirely client-side and runs in the browser.

## Playing

1. Open `index.html` in any modern browser. No additional setup is required.
2. Follow the prompts to spin the wheel, practice addition and multiplication, and progress through the levels.
3. Scores and the current level are saved in `localStorage`, so your progress and high scores persist between sessions.

Enjoy sharpening your math skills!
