# Multiplication Mania

This repository contains a small web-based game to practice multiplication tables. The game is entirely client-side and runs in the browser.

## Playing

1. Open `index.html` in any modern browser. No additional setup is required.
2. The game now begins with a short repeated-addition exercise at **Level 0**.
   Spin the wheel, complete the addition practice, then continue on to the
   usual fill-in and quiz rounds.
3. Scores and the current level are saved in `localStorage`, so your progress
   and high scores persist between sessions.

Enjoy sharpening your math skills!
